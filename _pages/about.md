### Personal life
Hi! In real life, my name is Simone Aonzo, online I'm known as "packmad".

Iâ€™m [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). I was born in 1988 in [Savona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savona) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Gz_NGS5x4)].

But I studied, lived, and worked for many years in [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa). 
I have mixed feelings about Genova, but I consider it one of the most magical cities I've ever seen [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJI7-nO98c)].

At the moment, I live in [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), and work at [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/) in the [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) technology park.

So, I always woke up with the scent of the sea!

I'm (proudly) father of twins, Francesco and Alessandro, they were born in 2010. I discovered a new world through their eyes.

I was a pro [K1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-1) kickboxing fighter until 2015. I won two belts: amateur [European Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/06/loanesi-alle-stelle-weekend-di-successi-per-il-polizzano-perlungher/) and professional [Italian Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/12/loano-ospita-linternational-fight-show/) [[video]](https://youtu.be/9Yob7mGum9g). 
I am still training, but just for eating a lot of Italian food without getting fatter ðŸ™‚


### Study / Work
I've been working since I was a teenager: waiter, lifeguard, bricklayer, salesperson, and system/network administrator!

After I've set aside enough money, I started again to study, and I achieved the Master of Science in Computer Science (cum laude) at the [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) in 2015.

Then, I worked for one year as an Android Reverse Engineer at [Talos](https://talos-sec.com/) until 2017.
But it wasn't my way. I felt the need for a new challenge.

So, I started a PhD Computer Science and Systems Engineering at [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) and (finally) I've realized that my future will be in academic research.

> Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

I've finished my PhD in January 2020, and it has been a challenging journey!

After that I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher and then as Research Engineer at [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/aonzo-simone) under the supervision of [Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/).

Finally, it seems that after many adventures I have found my way: in April 2022, I was hired as an assistant professor at Eurecom, and I plan to continue my career here for several years!

My main line of research is Security & Privacy. 
More precisely, over the years I have devoted myself to working on (in chronological order): 
1. Mobile (Android) system security
2. Malware Analysis (Android and Windows)
3. Humans in the Cybersecurity Loop
4. Perimeter security


### Personal interests
I have a lot of hobbies, depending on the season (and sometimes I sleep):

* Sports: boxing, running, swimming, skiing, kayaking
* Motorbike rides (Ducati Monster 695)
