### Personal life
Hi! In real life my name is Simone Aonzo, online I'm "packmad".

Iâ€™m [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). I was born in 1988, in [Savona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savona) where I still live today.

But I studied, lived and now I work in [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa). 
I consider it one of the most magical ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg3Fq85azck)) cities I've ever seen.

So, I have always woken up with the scent of the sea!

Iâ€™m (proudly) father of twins, Francesco and Alessandro, they were born in 2010. I discovered a new world through their eyes.

I was a pro [K1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-1) fighter until 2015. I won two belts: amateur [European Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/06/loanesi-alle-stelle-weekend-di-successi-per-il-polizzano-perlungher/) and professional [Italian Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/12/loano-ospita-linternational-fight-show/) ([video](https://youtu.be/9Yob7mGum9g)). 
I am still training, but just for eating the Italian food without getting fatter ðŸ™‚


### Study / Work
I've been working since I was a teenager: waiter, lifeguard, bricklayer, salesperson and system/network administrator!

After I've set aside enough money, I started again to study, and I achieved the Master of Science in Computer Science (cum laude) at the [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) in 2015.

Then, I worked for one yer as an Android Reverse Engineer at [Talos](https://talos-sec.com/) until 2017.
But it wasnâ€™t my way. I felt the need of a new challenge.

So, I started a Ph.D. Computer Science and Systems Engineering of the [Department of Computer Science, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering](http://www.dibris.unige.it/) at [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) and (finally) I've realized that my future will be in academic research.

> Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

I've finished my PhD in January 2020 and it has been a tough journey, but there have been [results](https://simoneaonzo.it/publications/).

And? At the moment I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/aonzo-simone) under the supervision of [Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/).


### Personal interests
I have a lot of hobbies, depending on the season (and sometimes I sleep):
* [reading](https://simoneaonzo.it/books/)
* cooking
* motorbike rides
* yoga/meditation
* [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)
* poker and chess (very noob level)
* sport: boxing, crossfit, running, swimming

... but for me only one life isn't enough, I want to do a lot more!!!
