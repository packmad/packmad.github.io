Hello and welcome!

My name is Simone Aonzo (online I am also known as `packm(a|4)d`).

I am an assistant professor at the [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/) graduate school and research center, located in the [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) technology park on the French Riviera.

I work in the Software and System Security ([S3](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/)) Group, and my research areas are 
+ Mobile (Android) system security
+ Malware analysis (Android and Windows)
+ Human studies in security processes
+ Phishing

My publications are listed [here](/publications/).

I have contributed to the academic community by serving on the program committees of conferences such as USENIX Security and RAID, and as a reviewer for ACM TOPS. 

As for teaching, I have two courses. A basic one, "Introduction to Cybersecurity", and an advanced one, "Reverse Engineering Malware". 
In the spirit of open source, all my course material is publicly available [here](/courses/).

Beyond academia, I co-founded [ThreatNemesis](https://tnemesis.com/), a cybersecurity startup specializing in Android sandboxing technology - based on years of extensive research.


### Personal life

I'm [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), and I was born in 1988 in [Savona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savona).

I studied, lived, and worked for many years in [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa). 
I have mixed feelings about this city, but it is undoubtedly one of the most charming cities I've ever seen [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJI7-nO98c)]. At the moment, I live in [Antibes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibes), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). So I always woke up with the smell of the sea, I just can't get rid of it!

I'm a father of twins, Francesco and Alessandro, born in 2010. I have discovered a new world through their eyes. In my opinion, having children is the most difficult, but also, without a doubt, the most rewarding experience.

I was a pro kickboxing [K-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing#Oriental_rules) fighter until 2015. I won two belts: amateur [European Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/06/loanesi-alle-stelle-weekend-di-successi-per-il-polizzano-perlungher/) and professional [Italian Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/12/loano-ospita-linternational-fight-show/) [[video](https://youtu.be/9Yob7mGum9g)]. 
I am still training, I have no intention to stop, but only to eat Italian food without getting fat! ðŸ™‚

I have a lot of hobbies, depending on the season (and sometimes I sleep):

* "Mental riddles", like [Capture the Flag](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) and [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/)
* Sports: boxing, running, swimming, skiing, kayaking
* Motorbike trips (I own a [Ducati Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_Monster) 695)
* [Watching movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39105709/ratings?sort=your_rating,desc&ratingFilter=0&mode=detail)
* [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/81659096?shelf=read)
* [Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/simone4onzo) (awful player)
