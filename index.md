Hello, welcome!

My name is Simone Aonzo (online I am also known `packm4d`).


I am an assistant professor at the [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/) Graduate School and Research Center, located in the [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) technology park on the French Riviera.

My main line of research is Security & Privacy. More precisely: 
+ Mobile (Android) system security
+ Malware Analysis (Android and Windows)
+ Humans in the Cybersecurity loop
+ Phishing

I have contributed to the academic community through my roles on the program committees of conferences such as USENIX Security and RAID and as a reviewer for ACM TOPS. 

Beyond academia, I co-founded [ThreatNemesis](https://tnemesis.com/), a cybersecurity startup specializing in Android sandbox technology, built on years of extensive research.


### Personal life

I'm [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), and I was born in 1988 in [Savona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savona).

I studied, lived, and worked for many years in [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa). 
I have mixed feelings about this city, but it is undoubtedly one of the most charming cities I've ever seen [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJI7-nO98c)]. At the moment, I live in [Antibes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibes), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). So, I always woke up with the scent of the sea!

I'm a father of twins, Francesco and Alessandro, born in 2010. I have discovered a new world through their eyes.

I was a pro [K1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-1) kickboxing fighter until 2015. I won two belts: amateur [European Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/06/loanesi-alle-stelle-weekend-di-successi-per-il-polizzano-perlungher/) and professional [Italian Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/12/loano-ospita-linternational-fight-show/) [[video](https://youtu.be/9Yob7mGum9g)]. 
I am still training, but only to eat Italian food without getting fat! ðŸ™‚

I have a lot of hobbies, depending on the season (and sometimes I sleep):

* Sports: boxing, running, swimming, skiing, kayaking
* Motorbike rides (I own a [Ducati Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_Monster) 695)
* Yoga/Meditation/Stretching
* [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)
* [Watching Movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39105709/ratings?sort=your_rating,desc&ratingFilter=0&mode=detail)
* [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/81659096?shelf=read)
