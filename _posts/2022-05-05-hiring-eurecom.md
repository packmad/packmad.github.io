In April 2022, I was hired as an Assistant Professor at [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/). 
My main research topics are system security and privacy, focusing on malware analysis (Android and Windows). 

We -- the [s3 group](https://s3.eurecom.fr/) -- have several open positions to be filled, and we are looking for brave students who feel up to attempting the Ph.D. adventure!

I have made a couple of [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gx7d78Ww-43yHISqrBN-dKIYrmuSviBoyQBdZXj1e8M/edit?usp=sharing) about my perspective on the Ph.D.

Finally, the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/) on who we are and what we do in our research group.
