### Personal life
Hi! In real life Iâ€™m Simone Aonzo, online I'm "packmad" (in the past "six110").

Iâ€™m [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). I was born in 1988, in [Savona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savona) where I still live today.

But I studied and lived in [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa) for a while and I consider it one of the most magical ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg3Fq85azck)) cities I've ever seen.

So, I have always woken up with the scent of the sea!

Iâ€™m proudly father of two twins, Francesco and Alessandro, they were born in 2010. I discovered a new world through their eyes.

I was a pro fighter until 2015, [K1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-1) was my specialty. I won two belts: amateur [European Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/06/loanesi-alle-stelle-weekend-di-successi-per-il-polizzano-perlungher/) and professional [Italian Champion](http://www.ivg.it/2015/12/loano-ospita-linternational-fight-show/). But now I train my shots only for tasting the Italian food without getting fatter ðŸ™‚


### Study / Work

I worked as a system/network administrator until 2010.

After I've set aside enough money, I started again to study and I achieved the Master of Science in Computer Science (cum laude) at the [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) in 2015.

After graduation I worked as a security software developer at [Talos](https://talos-sec.com/) until 2017.

But I realized that it wasnâ€™t my way.
So I started a PhD in Computer Science and Systems Engineering of the [Department of Computer Science, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering](http://www.dibris.unige.it/) at [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) and I've realized that my future will be in academic research.

> Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
> [[Rick and Morty]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty)

But I always was a terrible student. Why?
Because I love break rules, I search the shortest path, I do not accept what I see and I want to do also whatever I love giving my best effort.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m in love with [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security). More precisely my research topic are:
* [Mobile Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_security)
* [Reverse Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering)
* [Binary/Malware Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware_analysis)
* [Exploitation Techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29)


### Personal interests
Every week I dedicate at least one hour to all my favorite activities (and sometimes I sleep):
* [reading](https://packmad.github.io/books/)
* cooking
* motorbike rides
* yoga/meditation
* [CTF competitions](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)
* poker and chess (very low skilled)
* sport: boxing, running, swimming

... but for me only one life isn't enough, I want to do a lot more!!!
