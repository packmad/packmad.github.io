Hi! In real life Iâ€™m Simone Aonzo, online I'm "packmad" (in the past "six110").

Iâ€™m Italian, I was born and I live in Savona in 1988.

I have always lived with the scent of the sea. I love swim and sail.

Iâ€™m proudly father of twins: Francesco and Alessandro. They are born in 2010.

I was a pro fighter until 2015 ([K1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-1) was my specialty), but now I train my shots for taste the Italian food without getting fatter ðŸ™‚

### Study / Work
I worked as a system/network administrator until 2010.

After I've set aside enough money, I started again to study and I achieved the Master of Science in Computer Science (cum laude) at the [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) in 2015.

After graduation I worked as a security software developer at [Talos](https://talos-sec.com/).

Again, I realized that it wasnâ€™t my way.
So I started a PhD in Computer Science and Systems Engineering of the [Department of Computer Science, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering](http://www.dibris.unige.it/) at [University of Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Genoa) and I think I've realized that my future will be in research.

> Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

But I always was a terrible student. Why?
Because I love break rules, I search the shortest path, I do not accept what I see and I want to do also whatever I love giving my best effort.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m in love with IT security.
